# MAK-hotel
A mock hotel management system on C++ that allows user to book room, store data using data file handling, sort the data using insertion sort and search through data using binary search.

##How to run the program
After starting the program, the main screen will be displayed with several options. The user is supposed to look through the options and select whichever sub-menu he wants to open.

There are several options where you can book a room, become a member to get discounts, check your booking details, etc. There is a specific sub-menu which is only for the employees and reuires a password to access. The password is 'MAKhotel'. By using this password, user can check all the bookings made which are arranged in a specific order.

I hope you have a fun time using this code.
